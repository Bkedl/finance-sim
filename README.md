##Overview

Please note: This project was developed offline due to internet constraints, so all work is contained in a single commit. It is intentionally smaller than my other project, serving as a conceptual foundation for a larger future project.

This is a console-based Java application simulating a personal investment portfolio, designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming, dynamic data handling and financial concepts. Users can add buy or sell transactions for various financial instruments, providing the instrument name, symbol quantity, and transaction type, while the program validates the input to ensure correct symbols, positive quantities, and valid transaction types. Transactions can be viewed with dynamically updated mock prices and the total portfolio value is calculated in real time to reflect current instrument prices.
